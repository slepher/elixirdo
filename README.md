## typeclass system

### typeclass

  behaviour 
  annotation -superclass([superclases])

### type

  impl of behaviour
  annotation -erlando_type(type, [type_defs])

### typeclass_register

  read ast of module of typeclasses and types generates three methods
  type(instance)
  is_typeclass(typeclass)
  module(type, typeclass)

## do 

## undetermined class

### how 

  generated by some functions does not return a instance of type
  such as applicative:pure / monad:return

### mix of undetermined typelcass instance and determined typeclass instance

  applicative:ap(applicativeA, applicativeB)
  type could be determined by applicativeA or applicativeB
  if both of then is undetermined typeclass instances, returns undetermined typeclass instance
  monad:bind(monadA, fun(A) -> monadB end)
  type cloud not be determined by monadB in fun(A) -> monadB end
  could only be determined by monadA
  
## default impl

## user def operator

  erlang does not support user def operator
  use /`op`/ instead
